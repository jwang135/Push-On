# Push-On
Push On is a Motivational Message Application. 
This app's intended target audience is for stressed college students who need a break from studying or motivation.
Sends a local notification when a new message is ready for viewing (message contains a funny GIF and a motivational quote). 
User has the option of selecting his/her own preferred GIFs and quotes from a survey based on the user's preferences. 
Also, the user has the option of letting the app know how stressed he or she is. 
Depending if the user likes to be sent messages when stressed or less, the app will send more or less messages. 
For the sake of usability and testing, the application's internal timer is set to send a message in much shorter intervals.
